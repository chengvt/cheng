\title{Train PLS for train dataset by cross-validation}
\usage{
trainPLS(x, y, maxncomp = 20, cvsegments = 10, round = 2,
  reduceVar = FALSE, cycles = 1, fixedncomp = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{predictor matrix}

\item{y}{prediction target vector}

\item{maxncomp}{maximum ncomp for calculation}

\item{cvsegments}{refer to mvrCv's segments argument}

\item{round}{round numbers}

\item{reduceVar}{variable reduction using VIP}

\item{cycles}{cycles for variable reduction}

\item{fixedncomp}{fixed numerical value}
}
\description{
Train PLS for train dataset by cross-validation. The preprocessing method will be optimized automatically.
However, the number of latent variables has to be determined manually. Planning to add variable reduction in the future.
