addstats(model, ncomp = length(model$ncomp), estimate = "test",
  location = "bottomright", show = c("ncomp", "R2", "RMSE"), round = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{object of class `mvr`}

\item{ncomp}{a vector of positive integers.  The components or number
    of components to use.  See below.}

\item{estimate}{a character vector.  Which estimators to use.
    Should be a subset of \code{c("all", "train", "CV", "adjCV",
      "test")}.  \code{"adjCV"} is only available for (R)MSEP.  See
    below for how the estimators are chosen.}

\item{location}{location of legend on graph. Look up legend for more details.}
